<p>Often a problem for many people weather your in Middle School, Highschool, College, a graduate,<br> 40 years old or a senior citizen we usually ask ourselves what our individual purpose is or was on the<br> people around us, suprisingly the answer might shock you.  </p>

<p>From every smile to every frown your actions play a vital role on your personal impact to society <br>and the people around you. You might not realize it's the small actions you do that have the greatest <br>impact. If you walk down the street and give someone of less fortune a dollar it could change that<br> persons whole day and maybe even their own perception of society
